# Votechain
Electronic voting, or e-voting, has been used in various forms since the 1970s, providing fundamental advantages over paper-based systems, such as increased efficiency and reduced errors. However, challenges remain to achieve widespread adoption of these systems, particularly to improve their resilience to potential errors. Blockchain is a disruptive technology of our time and promises to improve the overall resilience of electronic voting systems. This article attempts to use the advantages of the cryptographic base and transparency of the blockchain to implement an efficient e-voting system. The proposed system meets the basic 
requirements of electronic voting systems and allows end-to-end auditability. The document provides details on the proposed electronic voting system and its implementation using the Multichain platform. This article presents an in-depth evaluation of the scheme, successfully demonstrating its effectiveness in implementing an end-to-end verifiable electronic voting system.
